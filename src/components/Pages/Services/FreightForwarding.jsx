                        Freight forwarding consists of strategic logistics
                        planning and execution for the international movement of
                        goods, on behalf of shippers. Specifically, a freight
                        forwarder will carry out freight rate negotiations,
                        container tracking, customs documentation, and freight
                        consolidation, among other tasks.
